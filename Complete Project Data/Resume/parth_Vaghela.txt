PROJECTS

Single-stage ac/dc converter 
A single-stage ac/dc converter based on a half-bridge topology suitable for low-power-level applications is proposed. The converter has high power factor, low harmonic distortion, and tight output regulations. An asymmetrical control and synchronous rectification are employed to reduce the switching and rectification losses, respectively. 
FM Transmitter
This device is helpful in transmitting data within the FM Radio band of 88 MHZ to 108 MHZ. Finds application in The field of entertainment, data acquisition and remote controlling.
